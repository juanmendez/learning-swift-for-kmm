Learning the basics of the Swift language.

Every new journey begins with learning a programing language. Each learning chapter is going to be stored in its own branch. There is no fanciness in this repo other than running each code through the terminal. I am applying the same technique for these other languages learned int the past: [learning kotlin](https://github.com/juanmendez/learning-kotlin/) or [learning Dart](https://github.com/juanmendez/learning-dart-for-flutter.io/). I look forward to do some comparsison and also mock any of those demos written in Swift. 

You can learn Swift from this course by Simon Allardice [Swift Fundamentals](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/swift3-fundamentals)
