#Swift Variables

- Even using AppCode, there is a lot of codehint, I don't get to see while writing code in Kotlin or Dart.
- Data types are not enforced, as the initial value declares the type of the variable. Something also seen in Kotlin
- Variables are declared in lowerCamelCase
  - let is val in Kotlin, and final in Dart
  - var is the same in Kotlin, and Dart
