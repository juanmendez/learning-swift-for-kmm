# Swift

Conditions don't require parenthesis

```swift
if i < 10
{
  // block needs brackets if wrapping more than one line
}
```

Fallthroughs found in switch cases as seen in other c based languages don't work the same way in Swift.
Here is an alternative

we combine with commas

we can also use ranges
