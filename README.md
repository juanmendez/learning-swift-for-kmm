# Unit Tests for iOS

This is very simple and basic knowledge and practice of XCTest. 
I find this library very basic compared to Mockito or Mockk. 
I was surprised how to make a test run in isolation the method needs to be prefixed as `test`.

In this branch I also tried to do the exercise in Fleet. It is a nice IDE but not as great as AppCode.
I also find XCode at times buggy. What a dissapointment compared to IDEs created by JetBrains.

In my technology journeys I try to first learn the language to then start writing unit tests so I can practice the language in mind.
This is the case I am still learning how to try/catch in Swift. I still believe Kotlin is far more stylish than Swift.
